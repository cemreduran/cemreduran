# Hello I'm VetDev

Hi I'm Cemre Duran, veterinarian developer! At the beginning of 2022, I entered the software industry with the help of my Senior Full Stack dev friends. I made this journey as a hobby by selling my clinic as a profession. I am currently producing and developing mobile applications over React Native using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
