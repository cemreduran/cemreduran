# Hello to everyone!!

I'm Cemre Duran, exVet mobil software developer ^^ At the beginning of 2022, I entered the software industry with the help of my Senior Full Stack dev friends. I made this journey as a hobby by selling my clinic as a profession. I am currently producing and developing mobile applications over React Native using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
i play some instruments , i rides some motobikes , i write some codes , i love to learning new stuff !!
